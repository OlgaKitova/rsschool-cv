### ***About myself***

Front-end development is attractive because the result of your work is immediately visible. Bringing your website to life with Java Script turns you into a wizard.
My goal is to gain knowledge in this area and the opportunity to start my path in the profession of a front-end developer. 
At the moment, without any commercial experience, I have designed more than 7 landing pages, and for about 3 months I have been studying the basic JS. I enjoy learning new things and putting them into practice.
